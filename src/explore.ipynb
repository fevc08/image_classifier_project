The task was named \"Asirra\". When \"Asirra\" was introduced, it was mentioned \"that user studies indicate that humans can solve it 99.6% of the time in less than 30 seconds.\" Barring a breakthrough in computer vision, we expect that computers will have no more than a 1/54,000 chance of solving it.\n",

It was this paper that showed that the task was no longer a suitable task for a CAPTCHA shortly after the task was proposed."
